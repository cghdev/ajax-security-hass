# Changelog

All notable changes to the Ajax Security System integration will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- **Socket/Relay support**: Full control of Ajax smart sockets and relays
  - New switch platform for turning sockets on/off
  - Support for multi-channel devices (up to 4 channels)
  - Real-time state updates via coordinator
  - Channel information in entity attributes (channel_id, output_mode, operating_mode)
  - Added `async_turn_on_device` and `async_turn_off_device` API methods

### Fixed
- **Door sensor closed state detection**: Door sensors now properly detect both opening and closing
  - `door_opened` attribute now correctly initializes to `False` when absent
  - Previously only detected opening, not closing events
- **Users without notification access**: Integration no longer crashes for users without notification permissions
  - Returns empty notification list instead of raising exception
  - Logs informational message when access is denied
- **Real-time alarm status updates**: Improved reliability of streaming tasks
  - Added automatic retry logic with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 60s intervals)
  - Streaming tasks now retry up to 10 times on errors
  - Enhanced logging to track streaming status and state changes
- **Duplicate hub devices**: Fixed issue where hub appeared twice in device list
  - Hub device-level sensors now merge with alarm control panel device
  - All hub entities (alarm panel, sensors, binary sensors) appear on single device
- **Privacy**: Removed email address from debug logs

### Technical
- Parse socket channel data from `spread_properties.channel`
- Device type filtering now uses explicit whitelisting for detector-specific sensors
- Alarm control panel now includes `device_info` property
- Hub device sensors use space identifier to merge with space-level entities

### Migration Notes
- **Manual cleanup required**: Users may need to manually remove the old duplicate hub device from Home Assistant after updating (Settings > Devices & Services > Ajax > find empty hub device and delete it)

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Group/Zone support**: Full support for Ajax systems using group mode
  - Groups/zones appear as separate alarm control panels
  - Each group can be armed/disarmed independently
  - Night mode support per group
  - Real-time state updates via gRPC streaming
- **Hub problem monitoring**: New "Problem" binary sensor for hubs
  - Shows when any device has malfunctions
  - Detailed attributes listing all devices with problems
  - Includes device name, type, room location, and malfunction count
- **Enhanced hub data parsing**:
  - Device firmware updates tracking (device_firmware_updates)
  - Hub connection properties (offline/online delay settings)
  - Installation and monitoring companies information

### Fixed
- **Binary sensor filtering**: "Always Active" and "Armed in Night Mode" sensors now only created for detector devices
  - Previously incorrectly appeared on repeaters/signal extenders
  - Now explicitly limited to: motion detectors, door contacts, glass break, smoke, flood, and temperature sensors
- **Firmware update detection**: Fixed false positive firmware update alerts
  - Corrected confusion between auto-update setting and actual available updates
  - Now properly distinguishes system_firmware_update (setting) from device_firmware_updates (actual updates)

### Changed
- **Malfunction sensor**: Now only created for hubs and enabled by default
  - Previously created for all devices but disabled by default

### Technical
- Added `_parse_groups_from_space()` method to parse group data from Space protobuf
- Added `_async_parse_groups_from_snapshot()` for coordinator group updates
- Enhanced group state handling in stream updates
- Added AjaxGroup model with GroupState enum
- Device type whitelisting for detector-specific binary sensors
- Comprehensive logging for hub device data and firmware updates

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Binary sensors for device arming settings**:
  - "Always Active" sensor - shows if device is active even when system is disarmed
  - "Armed in Night Mode" sensor - shows if device is armed during night mode
  - These sensors are only created for detectors (motion, door, etc.), not for hubs

### Fixed
- **Keyboard/keypad device recognition**: All Ajax keyboard variants now properly recognized
  - Added support for: Keyboard, KeypadPlus, KeypadSPlus, KeypadPlusG3
  - Added support for: KeypadCombi, KeyboardFibra, KeypadTouchscreen
  - Added support for: KeypadBeep, KeypadBase, KeypadOutdoor variants
  - Previously these devices were showing as "unknown" type
- **Hub binary sensors**: Removed incorrect "Always Active" and "Armed in Night Mode" sensors from hub devices (these settings only apply to detectors)

### Technical
- Added parsing for `always_active` and `armed_in_night_mode` status fields from Ajax API
- Enhanced device type mapping with 30+ keyboard/keypad variant names
- Added debug logging for `spread_properties` and `device_specific_properties`

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Real-time notification streaming**: Notifications now arrive instantly via gRPC streaming, eliminating the 30-second polling delay
- **Binary Sensor platform**: New comprehensive device monitoring
  - Motion sensors with automatic 30-second reset
  - Door/Window contact sensors
  - Smoke detectors
  - Leak/Water detectors
  - Tamper sensors (disabled by default)
- **Last Alert sensor**: Shows most recent security event with timestamp, device name, room location, and event type

### Changed
- **IoT class**: Updated from `cloud_polling` to `cloud_push` for real-time capabilities
- **Timezone handling**: Fixed datetime timezone issues causing Home Assistant warnings
- **French translations**: Complete localization for all new sensors and attributes

### Technical
- Added `async_stream_notification_updates()` method for real-time notification streaming
- Implemented background task management for notification streams
- Enhanced coordinator to process notification events as they arrive
- Added `_async_process_notification_event()` for instant device state updates
- Proper cleanup of streaming tasks on shutdown

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed grpcio dependency conflict with Home Assistant
  - Changed requirement from `grpcio==1.72.1` to `grpcio>=1.62.0`
  - Now compatible with both Home Assistant 2024.10.x (grpcio 1.72.1) and 2024.11+ (grpcio 1.75.1)
  - Resolves issue #1 where integration failed to load due to dependency conflicts

### Changed
- Updated manifest.json to use flexible grpcio version constraint

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed
- Fixed grpcio version compatibility for Home Assistant OS 2025.10.4
  - Updated all v3 protobuf files to use grpcio 1.72.1 instead of 1.75.1
  - Changed manifest requirement from `grpcio>=1.60.0` to `grpcio==1.72.1`

### Note
- This version was superseded by 0.1.2 due to dependency conflicts with newer Home Assistant versions

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-08

### Added
- **Initial release** of Ajax Security System integration
- **Alarm Control Panel** platform
  - Real-time security mode control (Armed, Disarmed, Night Mode)
  - Live status updates via gRPC streaming
  - Instant synchronization with Ajax mobile app
- **Sensor** platform
  - Battery level monitoring for all devices
  - Temperature readings from supported devices
  - Hub status monitoring
- **Button** platform
  - Panic button activation
  - Siren test functionality
- **HACS Support**
  - Added hacs.json configuration
  - Added info.md documentation for HACS store
- **GitHub Actions**
  - Automatic release creation on version tags
  - ZIP package generation for easy installation

### Technical Details
- Uses gRPC streaming for real-time updates
- 60-second polling interval for minimal API load
- Direct communication using Ajax's mobile app protocol
- Compatible with Home Assistant 2023.8.0+

### Known Limitations
- Binary sensors not yet implemented (motion, door/window, smoke detectors)
- Only tested with Ajax Hub and basic sensors
- Requires connection to Ajax cloud services (no offline mode)
